# 🎟️ Event Attendance Tracker: *JoinUp*
This is the Group 4 project repo for IT4045C Enterprise Application Development (Fall 2025).

## 🚨 Group PSA 🚨
### Please *ALWAYS* **branch** off of `dev`, **not** main!

## 📝 Introduction

Our EventAttendanceTracker, also known as *JoinUp*, is a web application to be used by event organizers and attendees to streamline event check-in and attendance tracking.

- **Organizers** can:
  - create/manage events
  - register/import attendees
  - Check in attendees (via QR code or manually)
  - View live dashboards
  - Export reports

- **Attendees** can:
  - Register for events
  - Receive a QR ticket
  - Quickly check in

This system replaces manual sign-in sheets with a faster, more accurate digital workflow that provides real-time insights.

### JoinUp Wireframes & Flows

This describes the user experience for the JoinUp app, focusing on what the user sees and does at each step. Screens are described by their function and user-facing content, not by internal names.

### A. Check-In Flow

- The user is greeted personally and prompted to check in to an event.
- The user views a list of events and tickets, each with details.
- After checking in, the user receives confirmation and encouragement, plus a list of other events to explore.

### B. Host Flow

- The user is welcomed and prompted to host an event.
- The user fills out event details (name, description, location, time, image).
- The user enters contact information, which is auto-filled but editable.
- The user previews how guests will see the event.
- The user publishes the event and receives confirmation that it’s live and ready to share.

### C. RSVP Flow

- The user searches for events by city.
- The user browses a list of events, each with details and a button to view more.
- The user is prompted to register for an event.

## ⚙️ Functional Requirements
 
### 🎫 1. Organizer – Check-In
- As an **Organizer**, I want **to check in attendees using either a QR code or their 9-digit code**, so that I can **quickly check them in and confirm attendance**.

    - ✅ **Valid Data**
      - **Given** a valid QR code or 9-digit code,
      - **When** I scan it or enter it on the Check-In page,
      - **Then** the attendee is marked present and a confirmation is shown.
      - **Given** an attendee has not yet checked in,
      - **When** I scan their valid QR code or enter their valid 9-digit code,
      - **Then** their status updates to “Checked In” and the total attendance count increases by one.

    - ❌ **Invalid Data**
      - **Given** a duplicate code,
      - **When** I scan it or enter it on the Check-In page,
      - **Then** I see an error message and no new record is created.
      - **Given** an invalid code not found in the system,
      - **When** I attempt to scan or enter it,
      - **Then** I see an error message “Invalid Ticket” and the system does not update any records.

     - ⚠️ **Edge Case**
        - **Given** the scanner fails to read a QR code,
        - **When** I enter the attendee’s 9-digit code manually,
        - **Then** the attendee is successfully checked in and a confirmation is shown.

### 🙋 2. Attendee – Check-In
- As an **Attendee**, I want **to check in by scanning my QR code or providing my 9-digit code**, so that **entry is quick and seamless**.

    - ✅ **Valid Data**
      - **Given** I have a valid registration and a unique QR/9-digit code,
      - **When** I scan my QR code or provide my 9-digit code at the check-in station,
      - **Then** the system marks me as checked in, records the timestamp and method, and allows me entry.

    - ❌ **Invalid Data**
      - **Given** I present an invalid or duplicate QR code or 9-digit code,
      - **When** I attempt to check in,
      - **Then** I should see an error message and not be marked as checked-in.

    - ⚠️ **Edge Case**
      - **Given** the QR scanner fails to read my code,
      - **When** the organizer manually enters my 9-digit code,
      - **Then** the system still marks me as checked in, records the timestamp, and notes that the method was manual.


### 3. 🖼️ Attendee – Browse & RSVP (UI)
- As an **Attendee**, I want **to browse events in my city and RSVP easily**, so that **I can quickly find and register for local events that interest me**.

    - ✅ **Valid Data**
      - **Given** I am on the events page,
      - **When** I select my city from the search or filter options,
      - **Then** I see a list of upcoming events in my city, each with details (name, location, date/time) and a clear RSVP button.
      - **When** I click RSVP for an event,
      - **Then** I am prompted to fill out a registration form and, upon successful submission, receive a confirmation email with both a QR code and a 9-digit code for check-in.

    - ❌ **Invalid Data**
      - **Given** I am on the events page,
      - **When** I select a city with no upcoming events,
      - **Then** I see a friendly message indicating there are no events available in my city.
      - **Given** I am filling out the RSVP form,
      - **When** I leave required fields empty or enter an invalid email,
      - **Then** I see a clear error message prompting me to correct my input before submitting.

    - ⚠️ **Edge Cases**
      - **Given** I am on the events page,
      - **When** I attempt to RSVP for an event that is already full,
      - **Then** I see a message that registration is closed for that event.
      - **Given** I have RSVP’d to multiple events,
      - **When** I return to the events page,
      - **Then** I can easily view and manage my upcoming RSVPs and tickets.


### 4. 💾 Organizer – Event & Session Management (Business Logic & Persistence)
- As an **Organizer**, I want **the system to validate event times and session overlaps**, so that **scheduling conflicts are prevented**.

    - ✅ **Valid Data**
      - **Given** I schedule a session fully within the event’s start and end times,
      - **When** I save the session,
      - **Then** the system should accept it without conflict warnings.

    - ❌ **Invalid Data**
      - **Given** I am creating or updating an event with multiple sessions,
      - **When** I enter start and end times for a session that overlap with another,
      - **Then** I should see a validation error preventing me from saving until I resolve the conflict.

    - ⚠️ **Edge Case**
      - **Given** I attempt to create a session outside the main event’s time range,
      - **When** I try to save it,
      - **Then** I should see an error indicating that the session must occur within the event’s scheduled duration.

### 5. 🛠️ Attendee – Registration (Support/Flex)
- As an **Attendee**, I want **to register for an event online by filling out a simple form or scanning a shared link**, so that **I can secure my spot at the event without needing to register on-site**.

    - ✅ **Valid Data**
      - **Given** I open the event registration page,
      - **When** I provide my name, email, and required details,
      - **Then** I receive a confirmation email with a unique QR code and a 9-digit code for event check-in.

    - ❌ **Invalid Data**
      - **Given** I mistype my email,
      - **When** I try to submit the form,
      - **Then** I should see a validation error and be prompted to correct my input.
      - **Given** I leave a required (such as name or email) field empty,
      - **When** I try to submit the form,
      - **Then** I should see an error prompting me to complete all required fields before submission.

    - ⚠️ **Edge Case**
      - **Given** the event has reached the maximum capacity,
      - **When** I attempt to register,
      - **Then** I should see a message that the event is full and cannot accept more registrations.
